# Map Pathfinding Visualizer

A web-based visualization tool that demonstrates how A* and Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithms work in real-world map environments. Watch in real-time as the algorithms explore paths and discover the optimal route between two points.

## Features

- Upload and visualize paths on custom map images
- Interactive point selection for start and end locations 
- Real-time visualization of pathfinding algorithms
- Support for both A* and Dijkstra's algorithms
- Visual comparison between different pathfinding approaches
- CSV data integration for valid path points

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- C++ compiler (for pathfinding backend)

## Usage

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Upload a map image and corresponding CSV file with valid path points
3. Click on the map to set your start point (green marker)
4. Click again to set your end point (red marker)
5. Choose your preferred algorithm (A* or Dijkstra's)
6. Click "Find Path" to start the visualization

### CSV Format

The path data CSV should follow this format:
```text
x,y,path_id
100,200,1
150,225,1
200,250,1
180,275,2
225,300,2
